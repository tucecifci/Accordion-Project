## My process

### 💡 Built with

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for styling

### 🧠 What I learned

While building this project, I learned:

- Component Reusability: How to create reusable React components with props for dynamic content.
- State Management: Using React's useState to manage the accordion's open/close states.
- Event Handling in React: Handling user interactions (like onClick) to toggle the accordion's state.
- Conditional Rendering: Rendering the accordion's content based on its state (open or closed).
- Basic Styling: Applying CSS to style components and ensuring responsive design.
- Debugging Skills: Troubleshooting issues with React state and prop handling. <br />
This project also helped me strengthen my understanding of React's core principles, such as the "one-way data flow" and "component-based architecture."
